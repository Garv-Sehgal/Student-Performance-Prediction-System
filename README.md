# 📘 Student Performance Risk Prediction System

### A Machine Learning + Streamlit Based Student Risk Analyzer

This project is an end-to-end **Student Risk Prediction Web Application** that identifies students who are **likely to be at risk of poor academic performance**. It enables faculty to upload student datasets, automatically analyze performance, generate risk categories, and view interactive visual analytics.

The system uses **Machine Learning (Random Forest)** to predict risk and provides **real-time dashboards** using Streamlit.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔹 1. Upload & Auto Process CSV

* Upload any CSV with academic performance data
* Automatic cleaning & type conversion
* Department normalization (CS, Engineering, Business, Mathematics)
* Yes/No → numeric conversion

### 🔹 2. Automatic Risk Categorization

Students are categorized into:

* **AT RISK** (Total Score < Threshold)
* **WATCHLIST** (Threshold → Threshold + Buffer)
* **GOOD** (Above both ranges)

Thresholds are adjustable from the sidebar.

### 🔹 3. Synthetic Data Generator (Optional)

Generate additional **low-score synthetic students** to test the model or strengthen the dataset.

### 🔹 4. Machine Learning Model

Algorithm used: **RandomForestClassifier**
Model outputs:

* Prediction Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix
* Feature Importance Chart
* Predicted Category Per Student

### 🔹 5. Interactive Visualizations

* Risk Distribution Bars
* Department vs Risk Heatmap
* Feature Importance Graph
* Prediction vs Actual Comparison

### 🔹 6. Downloadable Results

* Full categorized CSV
* AT RISK student list

## 🧠 Machine Learning Overview

### ✔ Algorithm Used

**RandomForestClassifier** (Scikit-Learn)

### ✔ Why Random Forest?

* Handles mixed categorical & numeric data
* Works well with small/medium datasets
* Robust to noise
* Provides feature importance
* Low tuning required

### ✔ ML Pipeline Steps

1. Clean & normalize data
2. Encode categorical features
3. Select relevant numeric features
4. Split dataset (80–20) using stratified sampling
5. Train Random Forest
6. Predict risk categories
7. Evaluate with accuracy + confusion matrix
